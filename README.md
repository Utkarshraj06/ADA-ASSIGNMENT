1)N-Queens Problem Solver :-
An implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using a backtracking algorithm.

Problem Description
The N-Queens problem is a classical combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
Display valid board configurations that solve the problem.

2)Travelling Salesman problem using Branch and bound :-
The "Traveling Salesman Problem" (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in the field of computer science, operations research, and mathematics. It is a well-known example of a combinatorial optimization problem and falls under the broader category of NP-hard problems, which means that as the problem size grows, the time required to find an optimal solution increases exponentially.
In the Traveling Salesman Problem, the scenario is as follows: Imagine a salesman who needs to visit a certain number of cities and return to the starting city. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that allows the salesman to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city while minimizing the total distance traveled.

Mathematically, given a set of cities and the distances between them, the objective is to find a permutation of the cities that minimizes the total distance traveled. The problem can be formally defined as follows:
