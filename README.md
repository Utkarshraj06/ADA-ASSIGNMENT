N-Queens Problem Solver
An implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using a backtracking algorithm.

Problem Description
The N-Queens problem is a classical combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
Display valid board configurations that solve the problem.
